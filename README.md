# PDGA Stats Extension
Perfect tool for any disc golfer who also happens to be a stats nerd.

The standard functionality of the PDGA website is somewhat limited when it comes to gathering statistics from multiple sources into one page. This project was born out of my interest in how player ratings are calculated, and provides an easier way for players to see how their performances in different tournaments compare to each other.

Installation:
First, run the following command to build the files:

```
yarn build
```
After this, choose "Load Unpacked" at chrome://extensions, and navigate to the dist folder. Notice that developer mode needs to be on.


Please contact me for further questions (README is a work in progress).
